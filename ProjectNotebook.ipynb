    "    This class was my first experience programming in Python. However, since I've taken a few CSE class previously, the learning process was much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    My original focus was to make a Python project that the user could interact with. At the same time, I decided to solve on a problem I personally had: weather data from apps and websites can sometimes be overwhelming due to the excess information and bloated data. To resolve this issue, I focused my project around displaying weather data that would be easily digestible and functional for the average end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I searched for free weather API services and found OpenWeather. The API documentation, while plentiful, was complicated. Especially since this was my first time working with API calls, my workaround was simply trial and error. After many failed API calls, due to incorrect formatting, poor issues, bad indexing, etc., I finally got a working function that handled ZIP codes. Then I realized that some people may not know their ZIP codes, such as travelers, tourists, or children. I repeated the entire process for ZIP codes to process a city and state input. After pushing through the difficulties, I have this working prototype."
